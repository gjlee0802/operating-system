## 심층 문제

### 1. Assume that there are five frames, and all frames are initially empty. For each of the following page replacement algorithms, how many page faults would occur? Consider the following page reference string: (P 22-23 Second)

1,2,3,4,2,1,5,6,2,1,2,3,7,6,3,6
~~~

#### 1.1. LRU replacement algorithm

#### 1.2. Optimal replacement algorithm


### 2. How many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms, assuming one, four, or seven frames? Remember all frames are initially empty, so your first unique pages will all cost one fault each. Consider the following page reference string: (P 22-23 First)
